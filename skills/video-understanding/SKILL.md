# Video QnA using VLM through VSS Agent

Use this skill when you need details about the video which requires VLM to look at the video frames — for example the agent has **no** usable prior answer and needs a **fresh look at the pixels** for a specific clip.

---

## When to Use

- The user asks **what happens in the video**, what **objects / people / actions** appear, **colors**, **timing**, **safety**, or other **visual facts** that require watching the clip.
- The user asks for **details** that **cannot be answered** from existing messages, summaries, Elasticsearch/MCP results, or filenames alone—you need **model inference on the video**.
- Follow-up questions about **content details** after a coarse summary or after report generation.

Do **not** use this skill when a **database / MCP / prior tool output** already answers the question, unless the user explicitly wants **verification** against the video.

---

## OpenClaw workflow

1. **Clip** — Identify **sensor id**, **filename**, or **URL** for one video segment. If ambiguous, ask the user.
2. Call vss agent with the sensor id and ask for it to call video_understanding tool to answer the user's question.
3. Return the vss agent's answer back to the user.


## Query VSS agent (`/generate`)

```bash
# Set from deployment (compose / .env / host where vss-agent listens)
export VSS_AGENT_BASE_URL="http://localhost:8000"

curl -s -X POST "${VSS_AGENT_BASE_URL}/generate" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"input_message": "Call video_understanding tool to answer the following question about <sensor-id>: <user query>"}' | jq .
```

## Cross-Reference

- **sensor-ops** — VST storage/replay URLs so **`VIDEO_URL`** is valid for the VLM.
- **report-generation** — timestamped **reports** via the **VSS agent** (`/generate`); this skill is **direct VLM** for ad-hoc **video Q&A**.
